# Arithmetic

A simple browser game for practicing mental arithmetic, written in [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## To play

Open **index.hbs** in a JavaScript-enabled web browser. If your browser is unable to render it as a normal web page, change the file extension to **.html**.

## Feature requests

Open an issue with the tag "feature" and I might try to implement it, if I think it's a cool idea.

## Bug reporting

Open an issue and describe what happened, with as many details as possible. I'll try to fix it. If I can't reproduce the issue I may ask you for more information.

## Running tests

Open **test/testrunner.html** in a JavaScript-enabled web browser.

## Future additions

I may add these to the project later, but they are not present today.

* Pretty page styling
* Difficulty levels
* Better/more doc comments
* Precompiled templates
* Full tsUnit test suite
* Automatic build/minification process
